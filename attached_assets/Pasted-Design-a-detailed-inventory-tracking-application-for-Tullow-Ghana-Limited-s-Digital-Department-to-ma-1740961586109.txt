Design a detailed inventory tracking application for Tullow Ghana Limited’s Digital Department to manage equipment issuance and improve accountability. Use the following specifications:

Initial Inventory Data:

Initialize the system with this inventory (from the 'Filtered Inventory Report - Accra Sheet Only'):

Dell Monitors: 3 (sub-items: Dell 24” Monitors: 0, Dell 32” Monitors: 3, Dell 30” Monitors: 0)
Laptops: 39 (sub-items: Dell Laptops: 30, London Laptops: 9)
Dell Type C Chargers: 54
Dell Quietkey Keyboard: 39
Dell USB Optical Mouse: 47
Docking Stations: 69
Hardrives: 3
Pendrives: 16
HDMI: 7
iPhone Cases: 36 (sub-items: iPhone 12 Cases: 25, iPhone 13/14 Cases: 10, iPhone XR Cases: 1)
Screen Protectors: 136 (sub-items: iPhone 12/11 SP: 62, iPhone 13 SP: 73, iPhone XR SP: 1)
iPhone Chargers: 36
iPhone Cables: 26
iPhones: 29 (sub-items: iPhone 12: 0, iPhone 13: 29)
Logitech Headset: 19
Laptop Bags: 22
Each item has a 'Count' field representing the last known quantity, which the system will update as items are issued or returned.
Core Features:

Issuance Logging:
When issuing an item, log:
Issuer: Defaults to the logged-in user (selected from a dropdown of names).
Authorized By: Name of the person who permitted the issuance (dropdown selection).
Item: Selected from the inventory list (e.g., 'Dell USB Optical Mouse').
Quantity: Number of items issued (supports bulk logging, e.g., 3 mice at once).
Status: Dropdown with 'Permanent' or 'Temporary'.
If Permanent: Log issuance date (defaults to now, editable for retroactive entries).
If Temporary: Log issuance date (defaults to now, editable) and expected return date (user-specified).
Issuer’s Department: Defaults to 'Digital', with a dropdown for other departments.
Recipient’s Department: Dropdown or text field for the recipient’s department.
Update the item’s 'Count' by deducting the issued quantity (e.g., 47 mice become 46 after issuing 1).
Allow returns: Log the return date, add the quantity back to 'Count', and mark the entry as 'Returned'.
Name and Department Management:
Maintain a repository of names (for Issuer and Authorized By) and departments.
Include an 'Add' button to input new names and their departments.
Provide options to Modify (e.g., change a name’s department), Delete (remove a name), or Update (refresh details) within a settings or admin section.
Populate dropdowns dynamically from this repository.
Error Handling for Manual Updates:
Allow manual updates to an item’s 'Count' (e.g., after a physical count).
If the new count differs from the system’s expected count (based on logs), display an error:
Example: 'Inconsistency detected: Log shows 35 Docking Stations, entered count is 34. Verify your count or review the log.'
Options:
'Verify Count': Recount and re-enter.
'Review Log': Display recent issuances/returns for that item.
'Hard Update': Proceed with the new count, requiring a reason (e.g., 'Unlogged issuance').
Filtering and Search:
Filter logs by:
Date range (e.g., issuances from March 1-7, 2025).
Issuer (e.g., all items issued by 'John Doe').
Authorized By (e.g., all items approved by 'Jane Smith').
Recipient Department (e.g., all items sent to 'Marketing').
Display results in a table with columns: Item, Quantity, Issuer, Authorized By, Status, Dates, Departments.
Automated Reminders:
For temporary issuances, send a notification (e.g., email or in-app alert) to the issuer and recipient:
1 day before the expected return date.
If overdue, daily until returned or updated.
Audit Trails:
Log every change (issuance, return, manual count update) with:
Who made the change (logged-in user).
When (timestamp, e.g., 'March 2, 2025, 14:30').
What changed (e.g., 'Docking Stations updated from 35 to 34, Reason: Miscount corrected').
Viewable in a separate 'Audit Log' tab.
Pattern-Based Auditing Dashboard:
Include a dashboard tab with:
Item Frequency: Bar chart of most-issued items (e.g., 'Docking Stations: 15 issuances this month').
Average Borrow Duration: For temporary items (e.g., 'Mice: 3 days avg.').
Discrepancy Rate: Number of times manual counts mismatched logs (e.g., 'Docking Stations: 2 discrepancies in 6 months').
Overdue Items: Table of items past due (e.g., 'Mouse, due March 1, 2025, 2 days late').
Use basic stats (e.g., averages, counts) to highlight trends and suggest audit focus areas (e.g., 'High discrepancy in Docking Stations—audit recommended').
User Interface:

Clean, intuitive design with tabs: 'Inventory' (current counts), 'Issue/Return' (logging), 'Logs' (history), 'Dashboard' (stats), 'Settings' (name/department management).
Dropdowns for names, items, and departments.
Buttons for 'Add', 'Modify', 'Delete', 'Update' in Settings.
Current date for defaults: March 2, 2025 (adjustable by user).
Notes:

Assume verbal approval happens offline; no in-app approval workflow.
Prioritize usability for a small team with varying permissions (e.g., National Service Personnel issuing, contract individuals authorizing)."
